===Geodesic-based distance reveals non-linear topological featuresin neural activity from mouse visual cortex===


Before running any of the code the Algorithms.py should be run as it is used in every other script.
Top_features_dat.py calculates the significant topological features in all the datasets, it can be ran for both the full stimulus set as well as frequency fixed cases. Its output is then used to generate the other figures.

Figure7 also requires that Figure5_6.py be ran beforehand.
